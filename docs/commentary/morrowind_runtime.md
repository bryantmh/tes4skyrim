# Morrowind runtime

**Code:** `morrowind_runtime/`, `external/openmw/`, `tools/generators/vendor_openmw.py`

Morrowind's dialogue, topics and journal run natively in Skyrim by porting
OpenMW's own dialogue engine and MWScript VM into an SKSE plugin, rather than
reshaping TES3 dialogue into TES5 DIAL/INFO records.

## <a id="why-not-record-conversion"></a>Why not convert the records

Morrowind's model is a topic list with keyword discovery, resolved by an ordered
first-match scan over 85 condition functions, with results in an uncompiled
script language and a journal that is an integer index per quest. Skyrim's is a
branch/view tree of authored, quest-owned lines.

The Oblivion→Skyrim path already pays heavily for a much smaller mismatch:
`tes5_import/dialogue/` is ~200 KB across 8 modules, and `conversations.py`
exists solely to re-implement a scheduler Skyrim lacks.

Measured against real `Morrowind.esm`, the records this would have to reshape:
**23,693 INFO and 2,358 DIAL**. None of them are exported today —
`tes4_export/export_morrowind.py` handles 20 signatures and `DIAL`/`INFO` are
not among them, so `export_record()` silently returns `[]` for all of them.

## <a id="the-seam"></a>The seam that makes this portable

`Interpreter::Context` (`components/interpreter/context.hpp`) is a pure abstract
interface whose only dependency is `ESM::RefId`. The VM, the compiler and
`KeywordSearch` have no engine coupling at all, so the work splits cleanly:

| Vendored unmodified | Rewritten against Skyrim |
|---|---|
| `components/interpreter/` — the VM | `mwscript/*extensions.cpp` — 458 opcode installs |
| `components/compiler/` — 315 registrations | `mwscript/interpretercontext.cpp` |
| `components/esm3/` — TES3 records | `mwdialogue/`'s engine calls |
| `mwdialogue/keywordsearch` — a trie | |

## <a id="vendoring"></a>Vendoring

`tools/generators/vendor_openmw.py` copies the subset the runtime needs from the
read-only checkout under `references/` into `external/openmw/`. The pipeline must
never build against `references/`, which is comparison-only.

The closure is **resolved, not listed**: the tool follows
`#include <components/...>` transitively from the interpreter and compiler
directories, pulling each header's companion implementation file. A hand-written
file list goes stale silently and fails at link time; a resolved closure fails
loudly and immediately when an upstream include changes.

`apps/openmw/mwdialogue/` is copied wholesale instead of followed. Measured:
adding it as a closure root resolves **1,604 files** — `mwworld`, `mwmechanics`,
`mwrender`, `mwlua`, all 168 of `mwgui`, plus MyGUI, OSG, Bullet and SQLite
support. Those reaches are exactly what the adapters replace, so following them
would vendor the engine we are replacing.

The TES3 records it reads are therefore named explicitly in `ESM3_RECORDS` and
seeded as their own bounded closure: records reference only other records, so
that closure terminates. **Naming them is deliberate** — it is the one hand-kept
list in the tool, and the compile fails loudly if it is short.

Deliberately **not** vendored: `mwgui/` (168 MyGUI files — a new SWF replaces
it), `mwworld/`, `mwmechanics/`, `mwrender/`, and `userextensions.cpp`
(console-only, 4 commands).

### <a id="closure-follows-quoted-includes"></a>The closure must follow QUOTED includes, both ways

Angle-bracket `<components/...>` includes alone resolve **95 files, and the
build fails**. Two kinds of quoted include are load-bearing:

| Form | Example | Resolves against |
|---|---|---|
| sibling | `refid.hpp` → `"esm3exteriorcellrefid.hpp"` | the including file's directory |
| root | `stringrefid.cpp` → `"components/misc/guarded.hpp"` | the source root |

A resolver that tries only one of the two silently drops files. Following both
takes the interpreter/compiler closure 95 → 111 → **113**, which is what
compiles; `components/esm` grows from 2 files to 16 this way, entirely through
`refid.hpp`'s siblings. With the TES3 records seeded alongside it, the vendored
tree is **193 files**.

`components/esm4` and `components/misc/strings` land in the closure but are
**header-only**; naming them in a `cl *.cpp` line fails the build with "cannot
open source file".

### <a id="phase-0-gate"></a>Phase 0 gate: it compiles standalone

Verified — `morrowind_runtime\build.bat openmw` compiles **34 translation
units** (the whole MWScript compiler and interpreter, plus the `RefId` and
logging support they pull in) to 7.9 MB of objects with:

```
/std:c++20 /permissive- /Zc:__cplusplus /EHsc /O2 /MD /W3
```

C++20 is required — upstream sets `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20` and
`Interpreter::installSegment` takes an `auto&` parameter. **No OSG, MyGUI,
Bullet or SDL**, and the closure contains no third-party include at all, which
is what makes the VM portable in the first place.

## <a id="licensing"></a>Licensing

OpenMW is **GPL-3.0**, vendored from 0.52.0 (`b4b1c5ae`). This follows the
pattern `external/pynifly_hkx/` already established: the project's own code is
MIT, everything under `external/` carries its own license.

The runtime is its own DLL — `MorrowindRuntime.dll` — and that boundary is what
keeps the license contained. `TESRuntime.dll` and `TESGameBridge.dll` never link
OpenMW code, so they are unaffected. Linking it into `TESRuntime.dll` instead
would make that whole binary GPL-3.0, `fire.cpp`/`guns.cpp`/`sever.cpp`/`hud.cpp`
included.

A few hundred lines (`skse_abi.h`, `log.*`, `json.*`) are **copied** rather than
shared with `tes_runtime/` for the same reason: a shared library linked into both
would put MIT and GPL code in one dependency graph.
