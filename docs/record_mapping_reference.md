## Record Format Differences: TES4 vs TES5

### Critical Structural Requirements for TES5

1. **OBND (Object Bounds)** — 12-byte struct required on nearly all item/object records (ACTI, ALCH, AMMO, ARMO, BOOK, CONT, DOOR, ENCH, FLOR, FURN, INGR, KEYM, LIGH, MISC, NPC_, SLGM, SPEL, SCRL, STAT, TREE, WEAP, and more). TES4 has no OBND. **Missing OBND will cause the engine to reject records.**

2. **File Header (TES4 record)** — HEDR version must be 1.7 (Skyrim LE) or 1.71 (SSE), not 1.0 (Oblivion). Form version = 44 for SSE.

3. **Form Version** — Each TES5 record header has a form version field. SSE = 44, LE = 43. Some record structures differ by form version.

4. **No SCRI** — TES4 uses SCRI (FormID → SCPT record). TES5 uses VMAD (Virtual Machine Adapter) for Papyrus. VMAD cannot be auto-generated from TES4 scripts.

5. **Keyword System (KSIZ/KWDA)** — TES5 records extensively use keywords. ARMO, WEAP, NPC_, SPEL, ALCH, INGR, RACE, and many others have keyword arrays. Many game systems depend on specific keywords.

6. **Localized Strings** — When the TES4 header has the Localized flag (0x80), FULL/DESC/etc. become LString indices. Non-localized plugins use inline strings.

### Record Type Mapping

| TES4 Type | TES5 Type | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| ACTI | ACTI | Add OBND. Needs VMAD instead of SCRI. |
| ALCH | ALCH | Add OBND. ENIT restructured. Effects need MGEF FormID resolution. |
| AMMO | AMMO | Add OBND. DATA restructured. Needs DNAM for projectile ref. |
| ANIO | ANIO | Minor changes. |
| APPA | MISC | No apparatus in TES5. Convert to MISC. |
| ARMO | ARMO | **Major changes**: BMDT(4B)→BOD2(8B), 16→32 biped slots. Armor models move to ARMA records. ARMO references ARMA via MODL array. No direct mesh on ARMO. Add OBND, RNAM (race), keywords. |
| BOOK | BOOK | Add OBND. DATA restructured. Skill teaching uses TES5 skill enum. |
| BSGN | *(none)* | Birthsigns don't exist. Spells should go to Race records or Standing Stones. Exported as BSGN_SPELLS for reference. |
| CELL | CELL | DATA: U8→U16 flags. Lighting (XCLL) expanded. New: LTMP (lighting template), XLCN (location), XCAS (acoustic space), XCMO (music type). |
| CLAS | CLAS | Simplified in TES5. No attributes/skills. Only Flags, Teaches, MaxTraining. |
| CLMT | CLMT | Minor changes. |
| CLOT | ARMO | Clothing → ARMO with ArmorType=Clothing in BOD2. Same ARMA requirement. |
| CONT | CONT | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| CREA | NPC_ | **No CREA in TES5**. Must convert to NPC_. TES4 creature stats (attributes, skills) must map to TES5 DNAM. Needs race assignment. |
| CSTY | CSTY | **Completely restructured**: TES4 CSTD/CSAD → TES5 CSGD/CSMD/CSME. |
| DIAL | DIAL | Categories restructured. TES5 adds DLBR (Dialog Branch) and DLVW (Dialog View). |
| DOOR | DOOR | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| EFSH | EFSH | DATA structure differs. |

| EYES | EYES | Minor changes. |
| FACT | FACT | DATA flags differ slightly. Crime data: CNAM→CRVA. |
| FLOR | FLOR | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| FURN | FURN | Add OBND. Furniture markers restructured (FNMK was a U32 bitmask; TES5 uses entry-based system with FNPR). |
| GLOB | GLOB | Identical. |
| GMST | GMST | Many settings differ but format is same. Some TES4 GMSTs don't exist in TES5. |
| GRAS | GRAS | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| HAIR | HDPT | Hair→Head Part. TES5 HDPT has Type=3 (Hair), flags, extra parts list, TNAM (texture set). |
| IDLE | IDLE | Add conditions changes. |
| INFO | INFO | **Major restructuring**: TES5 INFO uses VMAD fragments, ENAM, different response structure (TRDA vs TRDT), conditions restructured. |
| INGR | INGR | Add OBND. ENIT restructured. Effects need MGEF resolution. TES5 ingredients have exactly 4 effects. |
| KEYM | KEYM | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| LAND | LAND | Compatible heightmap structure. Texture layers may need LTEX FormID remapping. |
| LIGH | LIGH | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| LSCR | LSCR | Add OBND. TES5 uses NNAM (loading screen text) instead of ICON+DESC. |
| LTEX | LTEX | **Restructured**: TES4 uses ICON (texture path) + HNAM + SNAM + Grasses. TES5 uses TNAM (→TXST record) + HNAM(→MATT) + SNAM + Grasses. Needs TXST creation. |
| LVLC | LVLN | Leveled Creature → Leveled NPC. Same entry format (LVLO). |
| LVLI | LVLI | Same entry format. Minor flag differences. |
| LVSP | LVSP | Same entry format. |
| MGEF | MGEF | **Major restructuring**: TES4 uses 4-char codes (OBME), FormID-based effects (EFID/EFIT). TES5 MGEF has completely different DATA struct. Magic school → skill enum. |
| MISC | MISC | Add OBND. Minor changes. |
| NPC_ | NPC_ | **Massive restructuring**: ACBS different fields. DATA(33B)→empty marker. Skills/stats→DNAM(52+B). Hair→PNAM(HDPT array). Voice→VTCK(VTYP). Outfits→DOFT/SOFT(OTFT). Perks new. Template system new. Add OBND, keywords. |
| PACK | PACK | **Completely incompatible**: TES4 type-based (Find/Follow/Escort/Eat/Sleep). TES5 procedure-tree based. Must create skeleton records. |
| PGRD | *(skip)* | Path grids replaced by NavMesh (NAVM). Cannot auto-convert. |
| QUST | QUST | **Major restructuring**: DATA(2B)→DNAM(12B). Stages similar but restructured. Objectives are new. Alias system entirely new. VMAD fragments replace SCRI. |

| REFR | REFR | More subrecords in TES5: XLKR (linked refs), activate parents, locations, emittance. |
| ACHR | ACHR | Similar expansion. TES4 ACRE (placed creature) → ACHR. |
| ACRE | ACHR | Placed creature → Placed NPC (ACHR). |
| REGN | REGN | Minor changes. |
| ROAD | *(skip)* | Roads replaced by NavMesh. |
| SBSP | STAT | Subspace has no equivalent. Export as STAT. |
| SCPT | *(skip)* | Scripts must be rewritten in Papyrus. Source exported for reference. |
| SGST | SCRL | Sigil Stone → Scroll (closest equivalent). |
| SKIL | *(skip)* | Skills hardcoded in TES5. Exported for reference. |

| WRLD | WRLD | New fields: XLCN, fixed dimensions, various flags. |
| WTHR | WTHR | Cloud system redesigned (layer-based). HDR/lighting data restructured. |

### New TES5 Record Types (May Need Creation)

| Type | Purpose | When Needed |
|------|---------|-------------|
| ARMA | Armor Addon | **Every ARMO record** needs at least one ARMA. Holds the actual mesh models. |
| KYWD | Keyword | Many records need keywords for game systems to work. |
| TXST | Texture Set | LTEX records need TXST instead of ICON paths. NPC_ head textures. |
| FLST | FormID List | Package override lists on NPC_. Quest objective lists. |
| OTFT | Outfit | NPC_ default outfits. |
| VTYP | Voice Type | NPC_ voice assignment. |
| CLFM | Color | Hair color (replaces inline HCLR). |
| LGTM | Lighting Template | Interior CELL lighting. |
| MUSC | Music Type | CELL music (was U8 enum). |
| SNDR | Sound Descriptor | Sound data (SOUN is just a marker in TES5). |
| MATT | Material Type | Landscape material (was HNAM enum). |

## Known Problems and Skipped Records

### Records That Cannot Be Auto-Converted
- **PGRD** (Path Grid) → Must be rebuilt as NAVM (NavMesh) in Creation Kit
- **ROAD** → Replaced by NavMesh system
- **SCPT** (Script) → Papyrus rewrite required (source exported for reference)
- **SKIL** (Skill) → Hardcoded in TES5, no record equivalent
- **BSGN** (Birthsign) → No record type. Spells should go to Race or Standing Stone

### Records With Major Conversion Issues
- **PACK** — TES5 package system is completely different (procedural tree). Only skeleton records can be created.
  **Substitution (2026-07-09)**: PKID refs to skipped PACKs must NOT be passed through (they dangle → the
  actor has no working AI packages). NOTE: this was necessary but did NOT resolve the creature stuck-in-idle
  bug — the vanilla-asset A/B dog moved even with dangling packages. `tes5_import/packages.py`
  substitutes vanilla generics instead: creatures always get PKID `DefaultMasterPackageCreature` (0010F2A5) +
  DPLT `DefaultMasterPackageListCreature` (0010F2A6) — exactly what every vanilla wolf/dog/skeever carries;
  humanoids get one `DefaultSandboxCurrentLocation1024` (000BFB6B) standing in for wander/eat/sleep-type TES4
  packages (ref-targeted types — follow/escort/ambush — are dropped) + DPLT `DefaultMasterPackageList`
  (00021E81). Skipped CSTY refs are likewise replaced: ZNAM = `csWolf` (00057BE8) for animal/horse CREA,
  `DefaultCombatstyle` (0000003D) otherwise. TES4 aggression >5 now maps to TES5 tier 1 (the old >=40
  threshold left e.g. dogs at Unaggressive, which never initiates combat).
- **QUST** — Alias system, objectives, and VMAD fragments are all new. Only basic stage data can be transferred.
- **INFO** — Dialog response structure changed significantly. VMAD fragments replace result scripts.
- **NPC_/CREA** — Attribute system removed, skill system changed, many new subsystems (templates, outfits, perks, keywords).
- **RACE** — Almost entirely restructured. Only basic data (height/weight/skill boosts/spells) can transfer.
- **MGEF** — 4-char code system vs FormID system. Flag mapping is complex.
- **ENCH/SPEL** — ENIT/SPIT completely restructured. Effects need MGEF FormID resolution.
- **ARMO/CLOT** — Missing ARMA records means armor won't render in-game.

### Common Causes of ESP Failing to Load in Skyrim Engine
1. **Missing OBND** on records that require it (most item/object types)
2. **Wrong HEDR version** (must be 1.7/1.71, not 1.0)
3. **Wrong form version** (must be 43/44, not 0)
4. **Malformed record structures** — Wrong subrecord sizes (e.g., ENIT 16B instead of 36B)
5. **Invalid FormID references** — Pointing to non-existent records
6. **Missing required subrecords** — Some records crash without certain subrecords
7. **Wrong DATA sizes** — NPC_ DATA must be empty (0B) in TES5, not 33B
8. **CELL DATA flag size** — Must be U16, not U8
9. **Biped slots** — BOD2 (8B) required instead of BMDT (4B)
10. **ARMO without ARMA references** — Engine expects armor models via ARMA indirection

### Cross-File Reference System (Dependent Plugins)
When importing a dependent plugin (e.g., Knights.esp that depends on Oblivion.esm), the pipeline must:
1. **Load converted masters** — convert.ps1 adds converted Oblivion.esm to activePlugins during Knights.esp import
2. **Search all loaded files** — `FindMappedRecord` iterates `FileByIndex(0..FileCount-1)` to find parent records (CELLs, WRLDs, DIALs) in master files
3. **Create overrides for cross-file parents** — `CreateChildRecord` calls `wbCopyElementToFile(parentRec, TargetPlugin, False, False)` when parent is in a master file, which creates an override in the target plugin and automatically adds the master dependency
4. **Register masters in relink phase** — All loaded files are registered via `AddMasterIfMissing` so cross-file FormID references are valid when saved

**Key point**: `RecordByFormID(singleFile, formID, True)` only searches one file. Must loop `FileByIndex` to find records in any loaded file.

### NPC_ DNAM Skill Path Names
TES5 NPC_ DNAM stores skills as arrays. The correct xEdit paths are:
- `DNAM\Skill Values\OneHanded` (not `DNAM\One-Handed`)
- `DNAM\Skill Values\TwoHanded`, `Marksman`, `Block`, `Smithing`, `HeavyArmor`, `LightArmor`, `Pickpocket`, `Lockpicking`, `Sneak`, `Alchemy`, `Speechcraft`, `Alteration`, `Conjuration`, `Destruction`, `Illusion`, `Restoration`, `Enchanting`
- Plus `DNAM\Health`, `DNAM\Magicka`, `DNAM\Stamina` (U16 each)

## Skyblivion Analysis — Conversion Best Practices

Analysis of ~140 Skyblivion/Skywind conversion scripts in `external/Skyblivion Conversion Edit Scripts/`. These findings are incorporated into our import script.

### Race Override System
Playable Oblivion races map directly to Skyrim equivalents by EditorID:
- Argonian→$00013740, Breton→$00013741, DarkElf→$00013742, HighElf→$00013743
- Imperial→$00013744, Khajiit→$00013745, Nord→$00013746, Orc→$00013747
- Redguard→$00013748, WoodElf→$00013749
- DarkSeducer, GoldenSaint, Sheogorath have no Skyrim equivalent (create new)
- ImportRACE() checks EditorID and stores a mapping to Skyrim's FormID instead of creating a new record

### NPC_ Conversion (from Skyblivion)
- **ACBS Flags**: Only keep compatible bits ($01+$02+$08+$10+$80+$4000). Force autocalc stats for creatures.
- **Level**: PC Level Mult formula = `1 + obLevel / 20`. CalcMin doubled, CalcMax doubled (default max=100).
- **ACBS Offsets**: Health=Endurance, Magicka=Intelligence, Stamina=Strength (from TES4 Attributes).
- **AI Thresholds**:
  - Aggression: 0-39→Unaggressive(0), 40-69→Aggressive(1), 70+→Very Aggressive(2)
  - Confidence: 0-29→Cowardly(0), 30-69→Average(2), 70+→Brave(3)
  - Responsibility: <30→No Crime(0) + Helps Allies, 30+→Any Crime(3) + Helps Nobody
  - Mood: always Neutral(4)
- **NPC_ Skills from Creatures**: TES4 CREA has aggregate skills (Combat/Magic/Stealth). Mapping:
  - OneHanded/Block/Smithing = Combat, TwoHanded = max(blunt,blade,h2h)
  - Destruction/Conjuration/Alteration/Illusion/Restoration = Magic
  - Marksman/Sneak/Lockpicking/Pickpocket = Stealth
  - HeavyArmor = max(HeavyArmor, Athletics), LightArmor = max(LightArmor, Acrobatics)
  - Alchemy = Alchemy, Speechcraft = Speechcraft, Enchanting = Intelligence/3

### ENCH/SPEL Conversion
- **ENCH Cast Type** varies by enchantment type: Scroll→4(Scroll), Staff/Weapon→2(Fire and Forget), Apparel→0(Constant Effect)
- **SPEL Cast Type**: Always Fire and Forget(2)
- **SPEL Flag Remapping**: $10→$80000 (No Absorb/Reflect), $20→$100000 (No Dual Cast Modifications), $40→$200000
- **Target Type**: Derived from first magic effect's EFIT\Type (exported as FirstEffect.Type)
- **ENCH Flags**: Only keep No Auto Calc ($08→$01)

### FACT Conversion
- **Evil flag** ($02) → all crime flags ($0080+$0100+$0200+$0400+$0800+$2000+$10000 = Assault/Murder/Trespass/Pickpocket/Steal/Werewolf/Attack on Sight)
- **Can Be Owner** ($8000) set on all factions
- **Relation Disposition → Combat Reaction**: ≤-50→Enemy(1), =100→Ally(3), ≥50→Friend(2), else→Neutral(0)

### ALCH Conversion
- **Food Detection**: Flag $02 (food) → set food flag + ITMPotionUse sound ($000CAF94) + VendorItemFood keyword
- **Poison Detection**: Name contains 'poison' → set poison flag ($20000) + ITMPoisonUse sound ($00106614) + VendorItemPoison keyword
- Needs OBND, standard potion sound otherwise

### Magic Effects (EFID/EFIT) — null EFID = inventory CTD (fixed 2026-07-10)
- **NEVER write EFID=00000000**: the game dereferences each effect's base MGEF
  when a menu builds the item card → instant CTD on opening inventory with the
  item (crash log: `(AlchemyItem*)` in RCX + `InventoryMenu`). Applies to ALCH,
  INGR, ENCH, SPEL, SCRL alike.
- `_pack_effects()` (tes5_import/record_types/equipment.py) drops effects whose
  TES4 code has no Skyrim mapping and guarantees ≥1 real effect (INGR: exactly 4)
  by padding with zero-magnitude AlchRestore* fillers.
- Attribute/skill-targeted codes (DRAT/DGAT/FOAT/REAT/ABAT/FOSK) resolve through
  the effect's ActorValue via `MGEF_AV_CODE_TO_SKYRIM` (skyrim_overrides.py):
  e.g. Drain Endurance → AlchDamageHealth, Fortify Personality → AlchFortifyBarter,
  Fortify Blade → AlchFortifyOneHanded. Flat `MGEF_CODE_TO_SKYRIM` is the fallback.
- **TES5 INGR ENIT is 8 bytes** (s32 value + u32 flags), NOT the 20-byte ALCH
  layout (xEdit wbDefinitionsTES5 INGR).

### CELL Conversion
- **Remove Oblivion Interior Flag**: Clear bit $08 from DATA flags on interior cells
- **Clear Hand Changed Flag**: Clear bit $40 from DATA flags
- **Fog Duplication**: TES4 has one fog color, TES5 has near+far → copy to both
- **Lighting Template**: Skyblivion assigns templates by music type (dungeon/public/default) — we don't do this yet

### WRLD Conversion
- **Clear Oblivion Flag**: Clear bit 2 from DATA
- **Move No LOD Water**: Bit $10 → bit $08
- **Add DNAM**: Default land height = -2048.0, water height = 0.0
- **Add NAMA**: Distant LOD multiplier = 1.0

### REFR Conversion
- **Lock Level Tiers**: 0-20→1(Novice), 21-40→25(Apprentice), 41-60→50(Adept), 61-80→75(Expert), 81+→100(Master)
- **Map Marker Types**: Camp→5, Cave→4, City→1, AyleidRuin→7, Fort→6, Landmark→11, Tavern→14, Settlement→3, DaedricShrine→34, OblivionGate→34

### LTEX Conversion
- **Create TXST**: Each LTEX needs a companion TXST record with diffuse texture path + derived normal map path (_n.dds suffix)
- **MATT Mapping** (Material Type → Skyrim MATT FormID):
  - Stone→$00012F34, Cloth→$00012F37, Dirt→$00012F38, Glass→$00012F39
  - Grass→$00012F3A, Metal→$00012F3B, Organic→$00012F3C, Skin→$00012F3D
  - Water→$00012F3E, Wood→$00012F3F, HeavyStone→$00012F40, HeavyMetal→$00012F41
  - HeavyWood→$00012F42, Chain→$00012F43, Snow→$00012F44

### SOUN Conversion
- **Create SNDR**: Each SOUN needs a companion SNDR (Sound Descriptor) with the actual sound file path linked via SDSC
- **Loop flag**: TES4 `SNDD.Flags` bit 4 (`0x10`) = "Is Looping". When set, write `LNAM = 0x00000800` (loop) in the SNDR record. `LNAM` is a 4-byte struct: byte[0]=Unknown, byte[1]=Looping enum (0x00=None, 0x08=Loop, 0x10=Envelope Fast, 0x20=Envelope Slow), byte[2]=Unknown, byte[3]=Rumble. `0x00000800` in little-endian = bytes [0x00, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00] = Loop. Default (`LNAM = 0`) = no loop / plays once. `0xFFFFFFFF` is INVALID and causes no sound to play.

### CLAS Conversion
- **Trainer classes**: Skyrim's training menu reads skill/cap from CLAS DATA (Teaches S8 + MaxTrainingLevel U8 at offset 4), but Oblivion trainers store them per-NPC in AIDT (92/114 vanilla trainers disagree with their class). Phase 0c `create_trainer_records` clones each trainer NPC's class with the AIDT values and repoints CNAM; the NPC also joins `TES4JobTrainerFaction`, which gates the generated Training dialogue topic. Vendor barter gold becomes carried Gold001 (no TES5 field). See [dialogue_conversion_notes.md](dialogue_conversion_notes.md) (Barter/Training services).
- **VendorItem keywords (2026-07-10)**: Skyrim vendors only buy/sell items whose keywords appear in their faction's VEND formlist — converted items with NO keywords are invisible in the barter menu ("vendor missing nearly their entire inventory"). Every sellable converter now emits KSIZ/KWDA from `VENDOR_KYWD` (record_types/common.py): WEAP→Weapon (type 4→Staff), AMMO→Arrow, ARMO/CLOT→Armor/Clothing (TES4 biped bits 6/7/8 ring/amulet→Jewelry), BOOK→Book (flag 0x01→Scroll), ALCH→Potion/Poison/Food, INGR→Ingredient, SLGM→SoulGem, SGST→Scroll, APPA/MISC→Clutter, KEYM→Key. The service-bit→FLST table in actors.py must stay in sync (Weapons list includes Arrow; Books includes Scroll; Ingredients includes Food; Misc includes Clutter).
- **Skill Weight Algorithm** (from Skyblivion):
  1. Start with all TES5 skills at weight 0
  2. Specialization (Combat/Magic/Stealth) adds +2 to corresponding TES5 skills
  3. Two primary attributes: each attribute's associated skills get +1
  4. Seven major skills: mapped to TES5 equivalents, each gets +3
  - Attribute→Skill mapping: Str→OneHanded/TwoHanded/Smithing, Int→Conjuration/Alchemy, Wil→Restoration/Alteration, Agi→Sneak/LightArmor/Lockpicking, Spd→Pickpocket/Speechcraft, End→Block/HeavyArmor, Per→Destruction/Illusion/Marksman/Enchanting, Luck→all skills +1
